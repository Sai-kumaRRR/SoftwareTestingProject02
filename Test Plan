6. Defect Reporting Procedure
Criteria for identifying defects: Deviation from requirements, user experience issues, technical errors.

Steps for reporting defects: Using a designated template, providing detailed reproduction steps, attaching screenshots or logs.

Triage and prioritization: Assigning severity and priority levels, assigning defects to appropriate team members.

Tracking tools: Defect tracking software or project management tool.

Roles and responsibilities: Testers, developers, test lead, etc.

Communication channels: Updating stakeholders on progress and status of defects.

Metrics: Number of defects found, time taken to resolve, percentage of defects fixed.

7. Test Strategy
Step 1: Test scenarios and test cases creation
Techniques: Equivalence Class Partition, Boundary Value Analysis, Decision Table Testing, State Transition Testing, Use Case Testing.

Additional methods: Error Guessing, Exploratory Testing.

Step 2: Testing procedure
Smoke Testing: To check critical functionalities.

In-depth Testing: Using created test cases after stable build passes Smoke Testing.

Multiple environments: Simultaneous testing on multiple supported environments.
